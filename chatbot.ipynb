      "2. **Atlantic Ocean**: The second-largest ocean, it lies between the Americas to the west and Europe and Africa to the east. It is known for its distinct S-shaped basin.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Indian Ocean**: The third-largest ocean, it is located mainly between Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Indian subcontinent. It is known for its warm waters and significant trade routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Southern Ocean**: Also known as the Antarctic Ocean, it encircles Antarctica and is recognized for its unique ecosystem and role in global climate regulation.\n",
